## Problem Statement:
Given handwritten subjective answers, the system automates the process of correction by digitising handwritten text into a digital format for easier understanding, and to speed up answer evaluation via machine learning, as far as current systems allow.

There would be two types of users: students and instructors. Instructors submit question-answer pairs (in plaintext). Students submit scans of their handwritten solutions. This solution will be fed through the system for automated processing and evaluation. To enable ease of horizontal scaling, each module shall be a containerised application with clearly defined input and output, so new containers can be fired up to handle greater load as required.
